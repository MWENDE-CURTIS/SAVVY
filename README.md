##  Tech Stack

Frontend (User & Admin Interface)
We are adopting a single codebase approach to cover both the Web POC and the future mobile applications.

Component	Technology	Rationale
Language	Dart	Fast, efficient, and the native language of Flutter.
Framework	Flutter	Enables building high-performance, natively compiled apps for Web, iOS, and Android from a single codebase.
State Management	Riverpod	Recommended for robust, scalable state management, supporting complex features like the Meal Planning Engine.

Export to Sheets
Backend (API & Data)
The backend is structured to handle API calls, complex meal planning logic, and external integrations reliably.

Component	Technology	Rationale
API/Logic	Dart (Shelf/Aqueduct) or Python (FastAPI/Django)	Recommended to maintain language consistency (Full-Stack Dart) or leverage team expertise in Python for backend development.
Database	PostgreSQL	Ideal for handling structured data like user profiles, payment records, and menu details, ensuring data integrity.
Cloud Hosting	Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or AWS	Provides the necessary scalability and serverless options (e.g., Cloud Run) to manage fluctuating order demand.

Export to Sheets
Core Integrations
Integration	Purpose
M-Pesa API	Seamless, secure checkout process for users.
API Gateway	Normalizing and securing menu data pulled from diverse partner restaurant systems.
Google Calendar API	Facilitating the Smart Scheduling System for meal planning.
